# Recurring Events Views (recurring_events_views)
---

## Introduction
Recurring Events  provides listings for event series, event instances and
registrations. For many installations this will provide a satisfactory way of
managing events without the need to install extra modules.

For those cases which call for something more flexible, views integration is
provided by an optional sub-module called Recurring Events Views
(recurring_events_views).

After enabling this submodule, all listings are replaced by views and no further
configuration is necessary.

### Views are provided for;

- Event Series
- Event Instances
- Registrations

Admin views are available to user roles with suitable permissions. There are
also views for anonymous and authenticated users, for the front end.

- Admin views are provided with sensible default settings and exposed filters.
- The front end event series listings, display only future or current events.

The default views can be further customized as needed.
